Algorithms to use:
    - Fleases, full version for loosley synchronized clocks (because we need to work in the crash-recovery model)
    - Some sort of synch algorithm for the CRDTS that should be executed directly after the lease has been aquired
    - Have a look at the current merge functionality, isn't it working correctly?
    - Broadcast, what type of broadcast is it?

Plan for fail-recovery:
    - Implement a simple version of the fail-recovery model
    - Create a agent only used as a fail-recovery agent (is it still disitrubted, not really, what happens if tha agent fails...)
        Maintain a heartbeat mechanism: Each agent periodically sends heartbeats to the failure detector actor.
        Monitor heartbeat timeouts: The failure detector actor monitors the time since the last heartbeat from each agent.
        Declare failure: If an agent doesn't send a heartbeat within a timeout threshold, the failure detector marks it as failed and notifies other agents.
