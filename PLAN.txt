Algorithms to use:
    - Fleases, full version for loosley synchronized clocks (because we need to work in the crash-recovery model)
    - Some sort of synch algorithm for the CRDTS that should be executed directly after the lease has been aquired
    - Have a look at the current merge functionality, isn't it working correctly?
    - Broadcast, what type of broadcast is it?
