Algorithms to use:
    - Fleases, full version for loosley synchronized clocks (because we need to work in the crash-recovery model)
    - Some sort of synch algorithm for the CRDTS that should be executed directly after the lease has been aquired
    - Have a look at the current merge functionality, isn't it working correctly?
    - Broadcast, what type of broadcast is it?

Documentation:
- 23 feb, Tried to implmented FLEASE. But there is an issue, at the moment commit phase (where we actually write to the 
CRDTs are only being exectued once). Spent all day trying to make it work, but not fully there yet.
